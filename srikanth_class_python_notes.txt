In python
for can have else.
When break is not provided and range gets exhausted, the else statement will get executed.
if break gets executed else does not.

for n in range(2, num // 2 +1):
  if num

While can also have an else: construct.
It is not available in other languages

assignment 1
take numbers infinitely until user enters 0 and print the average
donttake negative numbers.
if user enters negative number, ignore and move to the next
continue can help

assignment 2
accept 2 numbers and display common factors between them. ignore 1 and itself

test input 10, 20
2 and 5 only because 10 we dont consider

--assignment 3
accept 3 numbers and display the largest of 3 numbers
-- assignment 4
accept the kind of object 1 for circle, 2 for rectangle, 3 for square
and then take necessary input to calculate area of the object.

test banks for java, python, c++

-- Data Structures
a) string
s = "Python"
s[0] will give 'P'
s[5] will give 'n'
we dont have array concept in python. Closest is list

s[-1] will give n in the word Python

it is called negative indexing. 
s[-3] 3rd character from the end
strings in python are immutable. Means u cannot modify strings
s[0] = 'p'

--Start 12-May
String structures
s = 'Python'

s[:-3] means -- going upto -3
s[:3] will give first 3 characters
hty
s[-3::-1] -- htyP
slicing works on other data structures also
String is like a collection and hence  iterable
for c in s:
print(c)

Ass1
Accept a string from user and check whether it is valid product code? Valid product code is made of 2 alphabets followed by 4 digits.
Ass2
Accept main string and substring and display where the substring is present in main string? All positions where it is present
Ass3
Accept a string and display how many upper case letters the string has.

s.count('do') will count the occurances of the substring in it
s.index('do') will give position of he first occurance of the string
s.find('did') will return -1 if the string is not found else the position. 
but if we write s.index('did) it raises error if the string is not found
s.strip() will remove leading and trailing spaces

list is a data structure
A list is a collection of values. Can use slicing and indexing
list is iterable like string
List is mutable
string is not mutable
l.insert(0,5) will insert 5 at 1st position
List can be heterogeneous
l = [1,'abc',True,10.2]
len(l) will giv u number of items
l.remove(3) will remove 3rd element in the list
names = [] -- empty list
names.append('Python')
'Java' in names -- will return True if Java exists in names

Ass 4
Accept numbers until user enters 0 and display numbers in sorted order. Clue -- use list.sort()

pop always returns the last value of the item. pop removes the item from the end l.pop(i)

tuples
List comprehension
Assignment 1


aCCEPT NUMBERS UNTIL 0 IS GIVEN AND DISPLAY ALL EVEN NUMBERS IN SORTED ORDER FOLLOWED BY ODD NUMBERS IN SORTED ORDER

Assignment 2

Accept a string which contains a list of numbers separted by comma and display the average of the numbers.

Understand the difference between append ane extend

Tuple is not a list. It is a collection. But importantly it is ummutable
t = (1,2,3)
type(t)
Remember parantheses are used in lists
t = () -- empty tuple
t = (1) is not a tuple with 1 element in it
t = (1,) -- tuple of 1 value
unpacking

t= (10,20)
a,b = t
print(a,b)
10,20
a,b = [1,2]
a,b = "ab" -- is also an example of ab

enumerate function gives both element and index. Gives 2 values as 1 object/unit
For that we need to use Tuple
