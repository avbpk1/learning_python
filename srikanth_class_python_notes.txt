-----Iterator and Generator
iterator is a type in python

l = [1,2,3]
li = iter(l)

--Above li is type of iterator and l is list. We can call methods associated with li. for .g

str(a) is same as saying 

page 109 -- diagram

iterable -- __iter__()
Iterator __next__() -- provides next value in the iterator till it gets exhausted and returns an error

How do you identify an object to be an iterator?

for n in l: -- # l should be iterable
functions like -- sorted also internally uses iterator

iterable is a container for values. The job of an iterator is to provide one value at a time

-- creating customer iterable and iterator
-- 30.png
def__iter__(self) -- iterator and iterable are 2 different classes
---what makes it as iterator is def__next__(self): method
Look at page 110 of course material
-- Stop Iteration Error

dunder iter method is mandatory to make a class iterable __iter__(self)

The job of the iterator is to take a value from a list and return it

-- 2 steps
define iterable. Iterable and Iterator are 2 main elements of an iterator class

--Range class is an iterable -- range is a function that returns an iterable

r = range(10)
type(r)
<class 'range'>
ri = iter(r)
type(ri)
<class 'range_iterator'>

THE GENERATOR
meant to generate values -- pg 111

Unlike iterator where you need to create a class to generate values -- generator is much simpler
How to create and use it.
-- generates values
steps are - -create a function which yeilds values (not return)
--yield is the keyword
-- generator concept is lazy -- it will give values on request and is lazy -- not eagerly

you can create a generator to generate any set of values.


-- assignment
create a generator that takes start and end and returns all palindromes in between those 2 numbers
gen_palindrome


-- in generator -- yield must be given
-- iterator
range is internally an iterable. When object is iterable , it is able to take values ane iterates

Every object we create should be close to a real thing
Person is super class. We do not want an object for person and hence make it as an abstract. Person class is marked as abstract as we dont create an object for that.
Studen and Employee are subclasses. We can create objects of Student but not PErson.
#Abstract Class

Doctor -- example

Doctor is the main class

RDoctor Consultant are subclasses from doctor

--------- Multiple inheritence.  Python and C++ support. Very important discussion. 

To create sub class C from 2 different classes -- A and B 

Whenever there is a sub class version that should be considered and not the one in superclass. 

Order of inheritence is important 
class C(A,B):
   pass           --- if the class is found in the first super class it stops there . If it doesnt find then it will go the next one. 
 --- As an extra -- in C# -- it is called virtual base  
--Look at multi level examples
--- 78.png -- example  A is a super class of B . Everything in A is inherited into B. And hence that is given priority over C

mro() -- method resolution order. Every class is derived from order object
mro is tricky

-- Inheritence
init is constructor
show() is display  -- 59.jpg

inheritence is about creating a new class from an existing class. It is not just about attributes but it is about classes also.
inheritences is about reusability.
for e.g. person class . student and employee can be reused from person class.

start with person class. create common things from details of employee and student. for e.g. name and email.
design thinking is required for class,

why show and ini are required?
uml diagram representing the design of the classes.

superclass and subclass
superclass is inherited into subclass. 
implement

IS A relationship
subclass is a superclass

None is a keyword whic is similar to Null (but indicates no value)

Java does not have default arguments but is achieved by overloading

--OnsiteEmployee(Employee) -- Onsite Employee is inherited from Employee
super().show() -- will take care of printing all 4 parameters

knowledge of functions is critical.

-- Assignment1 -- Create a new class-- Foreign Student. Additional attribute called country needs to be added.

---- refer 

--In Java -- super is a key word and in python it is a function

-- Inheritence is all about IS A Relationship

-- Association is all about HAS A relationship
credit card is one object and customer is another object. Customer HAS A credit card.

--Inheritence is also known as generalization as we start with generic and keep going down to specififcs.
e.g. student is a specific version of person. foreign student is a more specific version.
-- when ever there is over riding , it is followed by super()

-- Overriding -- why is show method repeated in each class definition. we are overriding a method of sub class in super class 

-- Assignment 2
 create classes to store details of resident doctors and consultants. For resident doctors, we have salary per month. For consultants, we have number of visits and charge per visit. 
 
a) For all we have name, mobile number and specialisation(e.g. cardiologist, paediatric).
b) provide a method to calculate the salary of the doctor and another method to display details of the doctor.
c) this is in addition to the constructor which is to be done any way. 
d) consultants may not be just visiting. they might be conducting surgeries. in that case, they may charge additional amount per surgery. Have a consolidated amount for surgery. Consulting surgery. He is not a resident. He does consultancy + surgery.

-----> What is a property and how to create a property.
--Refer to  get_category function in person.py
simplify it by giving p1.category -- looks like an attribute but executes some code. If that is what is required, then we have tocreate a property
For this -- you create the previous line as 
@property
Property -- when a property is referred -- it looks like an attribute but executes a function. The function which returns value. To do it we have to decorate with @property.
--decorators key word. -- 052.png screen
There are 2 types of properties -- read only. Properties can have assignments also. -- 53.png. @name.setter -- 54.png. Java does not have support for properties. c# also does not ahve. Python supports it using property decorator, setter decorator

-- When ever you define a class, a number of things have to be thought about design, for example -- what methods, what properties.

OOP
-- Constructor is nothing between __(dunder - double underscore)
creating classes is all about creating methiods . If it is init -- creating the requisite attributes


Name Mangling. By creating an attribute with a __ -- the intention is to express that it is a private variable. Althought it can be accessed from outside, it should not be done. It is not complete full proof. So nothing is private. If the intention is to make it private, never access it from outside.
-- example student.py

look at the screen shots for each step 
* important thing is to avoid hard coding -- example getdue(self) -- avoid return 5000 .
How do you avoid it.
Course Fee is applicable for all students.
 Best way is to store it in the class i.e. class attribute rather than object attribute. -- first line -- corurses = {'python' }
 They are called static attributes or class attributes
Object attributes are created/repeated for every object.  Class attributes are created for every Class.

def getfee(course)
    return student.courses[course] 

** The above is called static method.  -- @staticmethod -- line is called decorator or metadata. Changes the behaviour of the function. Very important concept for advanced programming. This is to inform it is static method. It is called with out the class name unlione others

line print(student.getfee('ds')) # call static method
--- Always use the function instead of directly calling the dictionary i.e. courses dictiomary in this example
-- In OOP , thje whole focus is on the design of the program. What classes you create, what members should it have. Whether you require data access
-- you can also initialise the coourse in def getfee(course='python') if required.

--- Assignment
In the account class, add a static variable called minimum balance.  Use this variable in withdraw. Dont allow the user to withdraw unless the min balance is maintained. Also provide a method that allows to find out what is the minimum balance. 
--page 82 one more example 
@staticmethod referred to as decorator. They are called with object name. listen to audi
-- Class method -- time.create()  -- where class is used as a parameter and create an object. ex
-- class method is also called factory method which means a method which creates an object.  . Not every class sghhould have it. Page 83. Listen to aud 27May
Instance Method, Static MEthod, Class Method comparision

--> Mostly instance methods are used. followed by static methods and then class methods. Class methods are used rarely.

--One more example

class Person:
   def __init__(self,name,age):
      self.name = name
      self .age = age
  
  def __str__(self)
      return f"{self.name} - {self.age}"
      
p1 = Person('Bill',30)
