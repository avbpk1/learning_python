I want to force every sub class to have ge tpoints

-- players.py

@abstractmethod -- decorator that needs to be imported . When you make a method abstract method, it is an indication that every subclass has to be implemented - overrride
ABC -- stands for Abstract Base Class

class Player -- 25.png -- diagram 

you have to import ABC class as below

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

2 important points
1) Every subclass must override
2) Player should not be created as an object i.e. No objects for player or student -- only sub classes should be objectable and abstract class , abstract methodes are important. Abstract class is 
defined by key word ABC

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod.
class Player(ABC)

---Improvement on previous assignment -- make Person as Abstract class so that Person cannot be created as an object.
Abstract Methods are to be implemented by all Subclasses -- e.g getpoints in players and occupation in person

2 important functions
>>>a=10 
>>> isinstance(a,int) # is instance is a method which compares -- Can be useful to find out what type of object it is 
True
>>issubclass(str,object)
>>True

---------Multiple Inheritence -- Important feature of python
Multiple Classes
Multiple Hierarchy

When one class is created from one or more classes -- it is called Multiple inheritence. It is availabe in C++ and Python only. Note -- Java and C# does not have it.

Inheritence 

--Suppose I want to implement total fee as an attribute but I want to treat it like an attribute but internally I want it as a process, then it has to be decorated as a property.
@property
def totalfee(self)
    return Student.course_fees[self.course]
    
    Other decorators are getter and setter.
 Decorators can change the behaviour of the class. -- 018.png

#pre defined built in functions for a caclass -- page 85 
New attributes for an object can be created -- 19,20.png. It is possible to create an attribute without pre-defining it

-- privATE_demo.py -- name mangling
How to Restrict access i.e. limit attributes from being accessed directly

self.__age = age # Private attribute
print(p1.__dict__) will return the dictionary of actual attributes -- even the private variables can be accessed -- for eg. 

print(p1._Person__age)

Private Members(Name Mangling) -- refers to the concept of just the name reference change -- for private variables.
Python is kind of created for the civilized where users respect the nature of the definition although it is not mandatory

So, if some thing is declared as private, though it can be accessed, the expectation is that it should not be accesssed.

# Special Method  - __str__
def __str__(self):
     return f"{self.name} - {self.age}

# Special Method2  - __eq__(self,other)
def __eq__(self,other):
     return self.name == self.name and self.age == self.age

Assignment -- Go back to all classes you created , __str__ and __eq__ (dunder eq) is for comparing the objects

# Special Method3  - __gt__(self,other)
def __eq__(self,other):
     return self.name == self.name and self.age == self.age

__gt__ or __lt__ is mandatory if we want to sort the custom classes -- equivalent to operator overloading in c# and c++



-- Create Custom Class and Sort objects of custom class
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self,length,width)

OOP in python
A method is a function inside a class. So , method has to be invoked only with the object

Where as Functions is a term that is used to to call with any associated object attached to it.

Data amd code are most important elements of any application. 
OOP is about encapsulating data and code. Data is in the form of variables. Code is in the form of functions. 000.png, 001.png

Encapsulation means putting data and code together. Data should be accesible only to the code.

l = [1,10]  -- list is a class, l is the object . class is like a data type or blue print. 
l.append(5) --  append is the function 
What operations can be performed on an object (i.e. l in this case is determined by the functions associated with the class -- list in this case)

Encapsulation , Inheritence
Summary -- Data amd code are most important elements of any application. 
Code is like librarian. Data is like books in the library. Analogy.

Use Case -- > Savings Account. To create a class called savings account.
Standard Naming Convention -- Pascal Case -- First letter of every word is upper case -- 002.png

a1 = SavingsAccount() # - a1 will be stored in slef
a1.open(1,"Andy")
a1.info()

#---below is an example of just creating an object but a2.info() will give error because there are no attributes. attributes are invoked by open()
a2 = SavingsAccount()           #003.png # Here there is an object without any data.
a2.info()                       

A better design is something like

a2 = SavingsAccount(1,"Andy") -- this will avoid extra step of open
print(a1.balance) -- this is allowed in python by default -- this is not allowed in other oop like java, c# etc. This is a case where the data is being accessed directly from outside and not via a function
                                                          -- the above can be avoided but to be discussed later.          
ideally -- another function should be written 
    def getbalance(self):
           return self.balance

All operations related to an object should be done using a method

 Unfortunately in Python there is no universal naming convention unlike Java and C#
 
 Normal Methods are to be explicitly called where as Constructor Method is automatically called

Modules
-- Modules can have statements and functions. It is possible to use module in another module. By way of importing . And then we can invoke those functions. 98.png
- str_funs.py in modules folder
import can have an alias. 
e.g. 
import str_funs as sf

from str_funs import count_upper

When ever you refer to a module , you are still referring to the module. All the code will be executed. It is not a good idea to run the code while importing the module. This is to be
executed only when invoke the module.

Modules can be imported. -- During import, we dont want to code be executed
Modules can be run. 
To do that 

print(__name__) -- double underscore -- all pre-defined name start with double underscore or dunder.
returns __main()__

if we invoke module directly , the name of the module is is __main__()
if we import the module , then module is imported and the name is str_funs

differentiate between invoking and importing

map function

map is an extremely power fnction -- 75.png
map(func,iterable) unlike filter which expects func to return a boolean -- it returns another value
It does not give a list. it will give one value at a time and is called a lazy function. So, where map is used, it has to be used in a loop to get all values out.
It does not eagerly do it. IT does lazily
